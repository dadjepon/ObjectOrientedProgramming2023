# Object Oriented Programming Course 2023

## Commit History

- **Commit #1:** Cohort A ([OOPCohortA](https://github.com/dadjepon/ObjectOrientedProgramming2023/tree/main/OOPCohortA)) and Cohort B ([OOPCohortB](https://github.com/dadjepon/ObjectOrientedProgramming2023/tree/main/OOPCohortB)) on 24th January 2023 at 13:50.

- **Commit#2:** We covered Control Flow this week. We highlighted that Control Flow has three main components: Selection, Iteration and Recursion. If you still remember, we gave some examples of Selection Control Flow as 'if' statements, 'if-else' statements, 'switch case', etc. Example of Iteration Control Flow are 'for' loop, 'for-each' loop, 'while' loop, 'do-while' loop, etc. Take the examples in this code commit as a standard or perhaps a rubric in Java coding so far.

## Tasks

- **Task #1:** For the `(Example_)Essentials` Class, check to see if the customer's status is 'Student', then they get a 25% discount. No discount is given to other statuses: 'Staff', 'Faculty' and 'Visitors'.
